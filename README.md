### Whole Cell DB - Developer - Summer 2013
* **Python/Django:** 
	* Used the Django ORM and H5Py to create a custom HDF5/MySQL hybrid database. 
	* Stores output from the Whole Cell Model simulation runs (>400Mb)
	* Output is stored as a set of n-dimensional arrays within the HDF5 files. Natively these HDF5 files are not searchable.
	* Made HDF5 files searchable by indexing their arrays in MySQL and coupling the records with  HDF5 objects via the Django ORM and H5Py library.
